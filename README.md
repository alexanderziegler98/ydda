# YDDA - You don't drive alone

# Challenge
Climate change is a huge problem which you can't tackle alone, therefore we decided to develop a game with a focus on community.
A big motivated community can have a great impact and spread the idea even further. That's why we hope to help car sharing and car renting
services to improve their CO2-emissions.

#Gamification
The main mechanic is an experience bar which fills by either driving eco friendly or solving tasks wich revolve around reducing 
CO2-emissions. The challenges help to dirupt the monotny. Even if you're not driving, you get experience if your friends do well, this 
way the game continues even if you're not driving.
When reaching a certain amount of experience you get points which can be spent e.g. on discounts.

#Community
By making community a main aspect of the gamification part, the user is encouraged to find other people who want to fight climate change 
as well as bulild a circle of friends thus creating a snowball system.

#Why we think it is a great idea
By making community and gameificaton our main aspects everyone involved benefits from this app. The user gets the oppurtunity to get 
discounts and have a more fun experience. The service provider can build a loyal community and get a better reputation. And in the end 
our goal to help the environment is achieved in a creative way.
