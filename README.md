##YDDA - You don't drive alone

# Inspiration
Climate change is a huge problem which you can't tackle alone, therefore we decided to develop a game with a focus on community. A big motivated community can have a great impact and spread the idea even further. That's why we hope to help car sharing and car renting services to improve their CO2-emissions.

# What it does
#Gamification
The main mechanic is an experience bar which fills by either driving eco friendly or solving tasks wich revolve around reducing CO2-emissions. The challenges help to dirupt the monotny. Even if you're not driving, you get experience if your friends do well, this way the game continues even if you're not driving. When reaching a certain amount of experience you get points which can be spent e.g. on discounts.

#Community
By making community a main aspect of the gamification part, the user is encouraged to find other people who want to fight climate change as well as bulild a circle of friends thus creating a snowball system. We used the facebook login system as we can access the friend list and it has almost 1.8 billion monthly users. This way we can take advantage of a big community that already exsists.

# How we built it
We wanted to create an android app. And intendet to use OTP for getting our information.

# Challenges we ran into
(OTP didn't work, not enough android knowldge, idea was too good we didnt watn to intimidate enemies)

# Accomplishments that we're proud of

# What we learned

# What's next for YDDA
